title="Javascript의 정의">
JavaScript(often abbreviated as JS)</a> is a programming language
that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.<br>
As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
often incorporating third-party libraries.<br>
All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute
the code on users' devices.
<p>JavaScript is a <strong>high-level</strong>, often just-in-time compiled language
that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.<br>
It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
and first-class functions.<br>
It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional,
and imperative programming styles.<br>
It has <strong>application programming interfaces (APIs)</strong> for working
with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
and <strong>the Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>.</p>
